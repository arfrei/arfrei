# My recent experience with GitHub

Hi professor, I hope you liked the kitten that I attached just for you, wishing you a great day. 
About my experience with this platform, I still find myself ***a little bit*** confused with some of it's sections and options (for example, how to create a README file), but I understand the importance of it, specially with the developer community. One as a programmer in process can truly learn from other users around the world, and in the same way, I can share my projects for others who might be interested. Even in our context, it's a great way of communication between students and professor.
This thing of *markdown* is impressive, there are a lot of things to learn with respect of styling, so I will try my best in this semester to improve my knowledge.
